# Landing-Page

In this project I will be exercising my ability to utilize flexbox as well as HTML and CSS. I will also be adding additional knowledge I've obtained through Youtube and may use some things we haven't touched on in the Odin Project yet such as CSS grid to make things easier.

The goal is to create an attractive landing page that captures the viewers attention.
